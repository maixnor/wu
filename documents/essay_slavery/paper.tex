\section*{Introduction}

The research question is simple: \qquad \textit{Does slavery explain why Britain got rich first?}

However, the answer is not so simple. What is certain is that slavery and the resulting economic dynamism had some influence. The literature is unanimous on this point. The uncertenties arise when we derive the extent to which the economy and wealth creation were influenced by slavery. The various arguments are explored in more detail in the following sections to enable a differenciated view on the interaction between slavery and Britain's impressive early economic development.

\section{Williams Hypothesis}
\subsection{Explanation}

Before diving deeper into the arguments, it is vital to understand triangular trade in the context of slavery, the colonies and the British mainland. This flourishing trading system between the 16th to the 19th century encompassed three regions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0em
    \item \textbf{Europe $\rightarrow$ Africa}: European traders export manufactured goods (textiles and tools) to Africa. These goods were sold or exchanged for enslaved Africans.

    \item \textbf{Africa $\rightarrow$ America}: The enslaved Africans are transported across the Atlantic in an agonising journey known as the ‘Middle Passage’. Ultimately sold to plantation owners in America.

    \item \textbf{America $\rightarrow$ Europe}: Plantation products such as sugar, tobacco and cotton, which are produced by labourers are shipped to Europe. They brought in considerable profits for British merchants and investors.
\end{enumerate}

The profits from this triangular trade were crucial to Britain's economic growth during the industrial revolution according to Williams. These funds were reinvested in industrial projects and provided vital capital to fuel the development of factories and technological innovation thereafter. This interconnected trading system illustrates the fundamental role of slavery in financing Britain's industrial progress. The Williams hypothesis arguments for economic dependence on colonial exploitation for the unprecedented growth \citep{solow1985}.

\subsection{Criticism}

Although the Williams hypothesis has found support, there is considerable criticism of its claims about the economic importance of slavery in financing the industrial revolution in Britain. A major criticism is the relative quantitative importance of the profits realised from slavery. Scholars such as Engerman argue that these profits were insignificant compared to British economic growth as a whole \citep{eltisengerman2000}. Critics such as Drescher support this view and claim that although slave-produced goods contributed to industrialisation, this influence did not begin until later than Williams assumed, indicating that the immediate economic impact was overestimated \citep{drescher1997}.

It is critical to recognise that these criticisms do not invalidate the links between slavery and economic development according to Williams, but rather weaken the effect size and therefore introduce the need for further research into estimates of profitability. The fine-grained impact of slavery on the economic situation of Britain in this crucial period may not be as comprehensive as it seems.

\section{Profitability and Impact on GDP}

Building on the previous critiques, we want to analyze the profitability of slave trade as a whole and its impact on British GDP. Some argue that the profits from the slave trade were not large enough to have a noticable impact on the already immense British economy. As mentioned earlier, scholars such as Engerman have claimed that profits from the slave trade were minimal compared to overall British income and other investments of the time. Others even argue that the colonies often represented a net loss for the Empire, as their operating costs exceeded the financial returns \citep{eltisengerman2000}.

Furthermore, scholars such as Drescher recognise the delayed effects of slave-produced goods, pointing out that the effects did not become apparent until much later in the Industrial Revolution \citep{drescher1997}. Harley expands on this point by claiming that the profits from the West Indian colonies were only of secondary importance to Britain's overall economic growth, implying that Britain's development might not have been as unique or rapid without the valuable resources from these colonies \citep{harley2015}. This would reduce the Williams hypothesis to the idea that the colonies merely provided the necessary raw materials necessary for creating the profits through industrial processes.

These findings on marginal gains pave the way for exploring alternative explanations for the importance of slavery, which probably contributed to economic growth in a more indirect but nonetheless significant way. Transatlantic slave trade played a vital role in developing the skills and economic structures that fuelled the industrial revolution in early Britain. Authors such as Berg and Hudson emphasise that the skills cultivated in slavery-centered economies were directly related to Britain's industrial capabilities, further supporting the idea of raw resource supply. This highlights the importance of understanding this underlying dynamics of industrial growth  observed in early Britain\citep{berghudson2021}.

\section{Investment Dynamics and Financing Changes}

The development of the British economy during the period of the slave trade cannot be explained by slavery alone; we must look for other factors. There is an important explanation in the literature that relates to significant changes in financing strategies and an evolving ‘investment mentality’. This mentality did not suddenly materialize out of thin air with slavery, but rather developed from centuries of experience in marine trade and the associated financing activities. British merchants were beginning to engage in overseas investments since the required willingness to take risks had emerged painfully over the decades. In essence this formed the preliminaries for the initiation of the slave trade.

Historians have noted that the developing financial system played a crucial role in the transition from a predominantly agrarian to a more industrialised economy. As Engerman argues, the profits from various economic activities such as maritime trade laid the foundations for the capital accumulation of the Industrial Revolution \citep{eltisengerman2000}. This essential transition, characterised by the emergence of institutions capable of conducting significant financial transactions such as large banks and insurance companies, is key to understanding how the slave trade became embedded in a broader Atlantic trading system in which wealth creation emerged not only from slavery but more broadly from trade, regardless of the cargo transported, and the skills associated with trade \citep{solow1985}.

It can be argued that the slave trade was an effect rather than a cause of profound changes in British capitalism. The ability and willingness of British investors to commit capital to such riskier ventures demonstrates the underlying shift in financial strategies. This pursuit of foreign profits contributed to Britain's overall economic growth via the change in mindset of investors. These interlinked effects were central to the industrial progress and change in economic structures well beyond the decks of a slave ship.

Ultimately, the introduction of additional capital through external investment shows the previously established economic base of financial frameworks and services. Slavery is one of the first prime examples of this. This emphasises the notion that growth came not from the trade itself, but from the mentality and financial systems that made such an enterprise possible and applicable in a broader domain than slavery \citep{harley2015}.

\section{Trade Volume and Logistics Advancements}

With the established fact that profits alone are not so important to the economic success of early Britain, let's move on to discuss another aspect: Logistics. It is immeasurable to understand that the logistics of the slave trade were complex task and the solution to it contributed more broadly to Britain's accumulation of skills during its expansion.

A key factor in the efficiency of the slave trade was the organisation and planning that governed the transport of slaves and cargo alike. The triangular trade system necessitates to continuously transport large volumes of cargo on a fixed schedule. Therefore ensuring continuous value creation to attracte the interest of investors and stakeholders alike. This systematic approach - effectively an economy of scale - facilitated predictable returns and created a strong incentive for continued investment in these activities \citep{harley2015}.

The volume of trade is a good measurement of the institutional support crucial in overcoming logistical challenges. The emergence of insurance companies allowed merchants to secure more funding through lower risk for investors. This is vital for conducting large shipping endeavors such as opening a new trade route and lays the infrastructure for future growth. This institutional framework not only enabled the slave trade to emerge. It also encouraged the development of more advanced shipping technology and infrastructure which is the base to meet the logistical demands of this expanding market could be introduced or expanded further.

The experience and skills developed in slave-based economies, supply chain management being one of them, were crucial and created innovative solutions to meet the demands of both national and global growing markets. These advances illustrate the interaction between marine trade and the evolving institutional practices characterizing this transcendence how British did global business \citep{berghudson2021}.

To reiterate, although the slave trade is often viewed solely in terms of economic profitability, a more nuanced view shows that the logistics of goods transport, planning and execution were equally important to the success of early Britain. The beginnings of supply chain management combined with greater trade volumes gave Britain an advantageous position within the Atlantic economy. These logistical achievements illustrate the interplay between maritime trade and the evolving financial practices that characterised this transformative period in British history \citep{harley2015}.

\section{Conclusion}

To summarize the arguments again: the relationship between slavery and British economic growth is present but not as strong as previously thought. Advancements in fields like logistics and more broadly investment-friendly frameworks within the British finance landscape contributed significantly more over the coming decades than the raw profits. Again, skill over money, for skill allows one to earn more in the future. This furthermore opened the door for riskier endeavors such as the triangular trade with slaves over the Atlantic. This resulted in an eventually more diverse economy with wast expansions into various business ventures finalizing the rise of Britain to an industrial superpower.

Furthermore, advances in logistics were vital to maximising the economic payoff of transatlantic trade. Particularly the ability to effectively transport large quantities of goods is a universal skill which is applicable to any economic activity. This usually results in a reinforcing loop of increased returns while other countries struggle to keep up. The precise organisation and planning required to maintain the slave trade on a regular interval is not only a proof of British ingenuity in marine trade and merchandize, but also reflected wider economic improvements where efficiency and profitability were paramount. This groundwork enabled a more constant flow of goods and capital. This resulted in the embedding of slavery within a complex interplay of Atlantic trade that benefited various sectors of the economy. This logistical network   spanning across the entire globe did not just benefit the plantation owners in America and the royals in the mainland but also the later emerging activities.

To answer the research question posed in the beginning: Well yes, but actually no.\citep{wellyes}

Slavery is a good explanation for Britain's early success. This is not because of the profits made, but because of the changes in financing practices and the skills involved in managing complex supply chains across large geographical distances.
