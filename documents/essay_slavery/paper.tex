\section*{Introduction}

The research question is simple: \qquad \textit{Does slavery explain why Britain got rich first?}

However, the answer is not so simple. What is certain is that slavery and the resulting economic dynamism had an influence. The literature is unanimous on this point. The ambiguity lies in the extent to which the economy and wealth creation were influenced by these activities. The various arguments are explored in more detail in the following sections to enable a debate on the interaction between slavery and Britain's economic development.

\section{Williams Hypothesis}
\subsection{Explanation}

Before delving deeper into the discussion, it is important to understand the concept of the triangular trade in the context of slavery, the colonies and the British mainland. This trading system, which flourished from the 16th to the 19th century, encompassed three regions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0em
    \item \textbf{Europe $\rightarrow$ Africa}: European traders exported manufactured goods (textiles and tools) to Africa, where these goods were sold or exchanged for enslaved Africans.

    \item \textbf{Africa $\rightarrow$ America}: The enslaved Africans were transported across the Atlantic in an agonising journey known as the ‘Middle Passage’ and finally sold to plantation owners in America.

    \item \textbf{America $\rightarrow$ Europe}: Plantation products such as sugar, tobacco and cotton, which were produced by enslaved labourers, were shipped to Europe and brought in considerable profits for British merchants and investors.
\end{enumerate}

The profits from this triangular trade were crucial to Britain's economic growth during the Industrial Revolution. These funds were reinvested in industrial projects and provided vital capital that fuelled the development of factories and technological innovation. This interconnected trading system illustrates the fundamental role of slavery in financing Britain's industrial progressy. The Williams hypothesis tries to argument for economic dependence created by colonial exploitation \citep{solow1985}.

\subsection{Criticism}

Although the Williams hypothesis has found support, there is considerable criticism of its claims about the economic importance of slavery in financing the industrial revolution in Britain. A major criticism is the relative quantitative importance of the profits realised from slavery. Scholars such as Engerman argue that these profits were insignificant compared to British economic growth as a whole {eltisengerman2000}. Critics such as Drescher support this view and claim that although slave-produced goods contributed to industrialisation, this influence did not begin until later than Williams assumed, indicating that the immediate economic impact was overestimated \citep{drescher1997}.

It is important to recognise that these criticisms do not negate the links between slavery and economic development according to Williams, but rather point to the need for further research into estimates of profitability. The nuanced impact of slavery on the economic landscape of Britain in this crucial period may not be as comprehensive as it seems.

\section{Profitability and Impact on GDP}

Building on the previous critiques, we will now analyse the profitability of the slave trade and its actual impact on British GDP. Some argue that the profits from the slave trade were not sufficient to have a significant impact on British economic growth. As mentioned earlier, scholars such as Engerman have claimed that profits from the slave trade were marginal compared to overall British income and investment. Others even argue that the colonies often represented a net economic loss for the Empire, as their operating costs often exceeded the financial returns \citep{eltisengerman2000}.

Furthermore, scholars such as Drescher recognise the delayed importance of slave-produced goods, pointing out that the effects did not become apparent until much later in the Industrial Revolution \citep{drescher1997}. Harley expands on this point by claiming that the profits from the West Indian colonies were only of secondary importance to Britain's overall economic growth, implying that Britain's development might not have been as unique or rapid without the valuable resources from these colonies \citep{harley2015}. This would reduce the Williams hypothesis to the idea that the colonies merely provided the necessary raw materials without causing the corresponding profits.

These findings on marginal gains pave the way for exploring alternative explanations for the importance of slavery, which probably contributed to economic growth in a more indirect but nonetheless significant way. Slavery and the Atlantic trade played a crucial role in developing the skills and economic structures that fuelled the Industrial Revolution. Authors such as Berg and Hudson emphasise that the skills cultivated in slavery-dependent economies were directly related to Britain's industrial capabilities, and highlight the importance of understanding this dynamic for reassessing traditional narratives of industrial growth \citep{berghudson2021}.

\section{Investment Dynamics and Financing Changes}

The development of the British economy during the period of the slave trade cannot be explained by slavery alone; we must look for other factors. There is an important explanation in the literature that relates to significant changes in financing strategies and an evolving ‘investment mentality’. This mentality did not suddenly emerge with the advent of the slave trade, but rather developed from a long history of maritime trade and commerce. British merchants had begun to engage in overseas investments that required a calculated willingness to take risks. This formed the basis for the initiation of the slave trade.

Historians have noted that the developing financial system played a crucial role in the transition from a predominantly agrarian to a more industrialised economy. As Engerman argues, the profits from various economic activities such as maritime trade laid the foundations for the capital accumulation of the Industrial Revolution \citep{eltisengerman2000}. This essential transition, characterised by the emergence of institutions capable of conducting significant financial transactions such as large banks and insurance companies, is key to understanding how the slave trade became embedded in a broader Atlantic trading system in which wealth creation emerged not only from slavery but more broadly from trade, regardless of the cargo transported, and the skills associated with trade \citep{solow1985}.

It can be argued that the slave trade was an effect rather than a cause of profound changes in British capitalism. The ability and willingness of British investors to commit capital to such riskier ventures demonstrates the underlying shift in financial strategies. This pursuit of exotic profits contributed significantly to Britain's overall economic growth. These interlinked effects were central to the governance of industrial progress and economic structures.

Ultimately, the injection of capital through investment in the slave trade emphasised already established economic practices and existing financial frameworks. This emphasises the notion that growth came not from the trade itself, but from the mentality and financial systems that made such an enterprise possible \citep{harley2015}.

\section{Trade Volume and Logistics Advancements}

Now that we have established that profits are not so important to the economic success of early Britain, let's move on to discuss another aspect: Logistics. It is crucial to understand that the logistics of the slave trade were an essential component of Britain's accumulation of skills during its expansion.

A key factor in the efficiency of the slave trade was the organisation and planning that governed the transport of slaves and cargo alike. The triangular trade system was based on the ability to continuously transport large volumes on a fixed schedule, ensuring continuous value creation, which attracted the interest of investors and stakeholders. This systematic approach - effectively an economy of scale - facilitated predictable returns and created a strong incentive for continued investment in these activities \citep{harley2015}.

The volume of trade illustrates the institutional support that is crucial to overcoming logistical challenges. The emergence of insurance companies, a necessity in managing the risks associated with shipping, allowed merchants to deploy their resources with greater confidence. This institutional framework not only supported the slave trade, but also encouraged the development of shipping technology and infrastructure so that the transport of goods could meet the demands of an expanding market.

The experience and skills developed in slave-based economies, such as supply chain management, were crucial and facilitated innovative practices that met the demands of both national and global markets. These advances illustrate the interaction between maritime trade and the evolving institutional practices that characterise this transcendent period in British history \citep{berghudson2021}.

To reiterate, although the slave trade is often viewed solely in terms of economic profitability, a more nuanced view shows that the logistics of goods transport, planning and execution were equally important to the success of early Britain. The beginnings of supply chain management combined with greater trade volumes gave Britain an advantageous position within the Atlantic economy. These logistical achievements illustrate the interplay between maritime trade and the evolving financial practices that characterised this transformative period in British history \citep{harley2015}.

\section{Conclusion}

In synthesizing the relationship between slavery and British economic growth, it is clear that the main drivers of wealth creation were wider investment dynamics and logistical advances. However, this transformative era had much more impact than just monetary gains from these activities. The emergence of an ‘investment mentality’ created an environment that enabled the allocation of capital to various riskier endeavours including the slave trade. This change in mentality allowed investors to take greater calculated risks, leading to a diverse expansion of economic activities that ultimately favoured Britain's rise as an industrial power.

Furthermore, advances in logistics - particularly the ability to effectively manage the transport of large quantities of goods - were crucial to maximising the economic benefits of the transatlantic trade. The precise organisation and planning required to maintain the slave trade on a regular basis was not only a testament to British ingenuity in maritime operations, but also reflected wider economic practices where efficiency and profitability were paramount. This infrastructure enabled a constant flow of goods and capital, embedding slavery within a complex network of Atlantic trade that benefited various sectors of the economy.

To answer the research question posed in the beginning: Well yes, but actually no.\citep{wellyes}

Slavery is a good explanation for Britain's early success. This is not because of the profits made, but because of the changes in financing practices and the skills involved in managing complex supply chains across large geographical distances.
