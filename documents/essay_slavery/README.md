### tectonic & Compilation

I recommend using `tectonic` to compile from latex to PDF. It handles all the setup of necessary latex components like compilers, packages and also does things like rerunning the references when another citation is used (common pitfall).

Compile using:
```sh
tectonic paper.tex
```

### Bibliography

I used GPT from the assignment to generate me the `references.bib` file. I recommend you do the same :)
