# Principal Component Analysis of Equity Market Returns

## Exercise 1: Data Preparation and Analysis (30 points)

Using the provided stock market data:

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries and data
# Convert data to xts object
```

1.1) Calculate daily returns for all stocks in the sample. Create appropriate visualizations showing:
- Return distributions 
- Time series patterns
**Interpretation here**

1.2) Analyze correlation structures:
- Create correlation heatmap
- Test for time-varying correlations using rolling windows
**Interpretation here**

## Exercise 2: Principal Component Analysis (40 points)

2.1) Perform PCA on the standardized returns:
```{r}
# Standardize returns
# Perform PCA
# Calculate explained variance ratios
```
**Interpretation here** (Discuss how many components explain majority of variance)

2.2) Analyze the first 3 principal components:
- Plot loadings across stocks
- Create time series plots of PC scores
- Test for patterns/seasonality in PC scores
**Interpretation here**

## Exercise 3: Portfolio Analysis Using PCs (30 points)

3.1) Construct portfolios based on PC loadings:
```{r}
# Create long-short portfolios based on PC1, PC2, PC3 loadings
# Calculate portfolio returns
```

3.2) Evaluate portfolio performance:
- Calculate Sharpe ratios
- Analyze drawdowns
- Test stability of PC-based portfolios
**Interpretation here**

3.3) Compare to traditional factor portfolios:
- Size
- Value 
- Momentum
**Interpretation here**

Important points to address in interpretations:
- Economic meaning of principal components
- Stability of PCA results
- Portfolio implications
- Risk management considerations
