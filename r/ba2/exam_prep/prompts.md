@workspace I have an exam coming up and I need you to generate some mock exams for me. have a look at the assignments, the exam should be similar in structure and content to the assignments. Take a concept from each assignment and combine it into a complete exam. Please output JUST a Rmd file which contains as the text the tasks to be fulfulled and empty code blocks to fll out. Add comments in the code blocks to give the code a bit more structure when I write it. 

We will have different datasets than we ones we have been given during the course. so there will be some data screening before we can actually start working on the data. It won't be anything tragic, but still enough to break just copy/pasting the code from the assignments.

please generate JUST this Rmd file and nothing else, no boilerplate and no explanations.
