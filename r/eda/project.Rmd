Preparing the Dataset to be used more easily

Begin Analysis

**DEMOGRAPHICS - we check if the randomization was done correctly**
**Overall:** we see the mean age is similar and the proportion of each gender is also similar - randomization was good.

```{r}

# AGE
#transform age into a numerical variable and compare means

#TODO run t.test
df %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(mean_age = mean(age))

age_anova <- aov(age ~ treatment, data = df)
summary(age_anova) # insignificant

# Visualize age distribution by treatment
boxplot(age ~ treatment, data = df, 
        main = "Age Distribution by Treatment Group",
        xlab = "Treatment", ylab = "Age")

#GENDER
#Compare the count and proportion of people in each gender in the data
#count observations per group

gender_data <- df %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  count(gender)

# Plot - COUNT
ggplot(gender_data, aes(x = treatment, y = n, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Gender Count by Treatment",
       x = "Treatment Group",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Gender") +
  theme_minimal()

# slight female bias

#plotting proportion is better
gender_prop_data <- df %>%
  group_by(treatment, gender) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

ggplot(gender_prop_data, aes(x = treatment, y = prop, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Genders by Treatment Group",
       x = "Treatment Group",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Gender") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +  # shows percent labels
  theme_minimal()
# female: 60%
# male: 40%
```

**Clear Sense**

Testing difference in means between groups

```{r}
# almost significant with 0.35
cs_anova <- aov(clear_sense ~ treatment, data = df)
summary(cs_anova)

# mean and median clarity
df %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(mean_clarity = mean(clear_sense))
df %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(median_clarity = median(clear_sense))

df %>% ggplot(aes(x = treatment, y = clear_sense, fill = treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Clear Sense by Treatment",
       x = "Treatment Group",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Treatment") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Regression

**basic regression:** insignificant
**lognormal regression:** *still insignificant*

```{r}
#treatment as a dummy variable - we run some regressions
hist(df$clear_sense)

# basic
reg1 <- lm(clear_sense ~ treatment, df)
summary(reg1)

# logarithm
reg2 <- lm(log(clear_sense + 1) ~ treatment, df)
summary(reg2)

#scaled - also insignificant
reg3 <- lm(scale(df$clear_sense) ~ treatment, df)
summary(reg3)
```

**Adding Variables**
***regression with all variables***
-   [Overall:]{.underline}
    -   p-value: small
        ```         
         1.907e-09
        ```
    -   Adjusted R-Squared: 44.69
-   Shows -
    -   **Journal condition -** significant - negative
    -   **Video -** significant - negative
-   Other possible explanations
    -   what I want  - significant - positive
    -   set_goals - significant - positive
**Possible interpretation**
-   Maybe doing a journaling task or watching a video makes people more self-aware and therefore makes them think they have less clarity ab their life goals?
-   having set goals means you have more clarity about your life goals

```{r}
reg_allvariables<-lm(log(clear_sense + 1) ~ treatment + watch_content + age + gender + whatiwant + write_goals + set_goals + life_goals, df)
summary(reg_allvariables)
```

- Settings goals and knowing what you want in life are significant, $R^2$ of 44%

**Polynomial Regression**

```{r}
#could it be a polynomial regression? - how do we know if this is better?
reg_poly<-lm(log(clear_sense + 1) ~ treatment + watch_content + poly(age, 2) + gender + whatiwant + write_goals + set_goals + poly(life_goals, 2), df)
summary(reg_poly)
```

- Polynomial is not fruitful here

```{r}
#WATCH CONTENT
table(df$watch_content)

watchcontent_data <- df %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  count(watch_content)

ggplot(watchcontent_data, aes(x = treatment, y = n, fill = watch_content)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Content Watching Habits by Treatment Group",
       x = "Treatment Group",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Watch Content")
```

**Adding interaction effects**

```{r}
reg_interact <- lm(log(clear_sense + 1) ~ treatment * whatiwant +
                     age + gender + watch_content +
                     write_goals + set_goals + life_goals,
                   data = df)

summary(reg_interact)
```

Both the journal and video treatments show significant negative effects on perceived clarity of life goals (clear_sense) compared to the control group. 
The variable whatiwant, which measures how much individuals base their decisions on what they truly want, has a positive and significant effect on clarity.

→ People who are more in touch with their desires report greater clarity in life goals.
The interaction between video treatment and whatiwant is positive and statistically significant (p ≈ 0.037).
→ This implies that for participants in the video group, the effect of being guided by one's desires is amplified.

Several levels of the set_goals variable are highly significant, indicating a strong association with clarity.
Variables such as gender, age, and watch_content are not significant predictors in this model.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = whatiwant, y = clear_sense, color = treatment)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Observed Interaction: Treatment × What I want",
       x = "What I want (Decision guided by personal desire)",
       y = "Clarity of Life Goals",
       color = "Treatment Group") +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r}
#gender
lm(log(clear_sense + 1) ~ treatment + gender * set_goals, data = df)
```
People who set clear goals for the next 5 years report significantly greater clarity in life goals. This effect is strong across all groups, but in some cases, the positive effect of goal-setting is even more pronounced among men. While being in the journal or video treatment slightly reduces clarity (perhaps due to increased self-reflection), setting concrete goals helps offset that effect — especially in men.


```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = as.numeric(set_goals), y = clear_sense, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Interaction: Gender × Set Goals",
       x = "Set Goals (ordered factor)",
       y = "Clarity of Life Goals",
       color = "Gender") +
  theme_minimal()
```
