```{r}
func_discr <- function(n) {
  d <- sample(c(1,2), size=n, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.4,0.6))
  mean(d)
}
avr_d1 <- replicate(1000,func_discr(10))
avr_d2 <- replicate (1000, func_discr(30))

hist(avr_d2, xlab = "Sample mean", main ="Distribution of Sample Means with 30 values in each average", breaks = 20)
# The one with n=30 shows more clustered around the center sample means, the shape appears closer to a bell curve. Left histogram n=10, on the other hand, shows more spread sample means.
```

```{r}
sd(avr_d1)
sd(avr_d2)
# We can also observe that standard deviation of the sample means decreases with n increase 
```

# b

```{r}
func_exp <- function(n2) {
  e <- rexp(n2,rate=1/2)
  mean(e)
}
avr_e1 <- replicate(1000,func_exp(10))
avr_e2 <- replicate (1000, func_exp(30))
par(mfrow =c(1,2))
hist(avr_e1, xlab = "Sample mean", main ="Distribution of Sample Means with 10 values in each average", breaks = 20)
hist(avr_e2, xlab = "Sample mean", main ="Distribution of Sample Means with 30 values in each average", breaks = 20)
#Same observation, with n=30, more bell-shaped histogram
```

# c

```{r}
func_unif <- function(n3) {
  u <- runif(n3,min = 1, max=5)
  mean(u)
}
avr_u1 <- replicate(1000,func_unif(10))
avr_u2 <- replicate (1000, func_unif(30))

hist(avr_u2, xlab = "Sample mean", main ="Distribution of Sample Means with 30 values in each average", breaks = 20)
# Right graph with n=30 is more bell-shaped and sample means are more clustered around the center 
# So, with all three simulations, we could observe that the distribution of the sample means got closer to normal distribution  as sample size (used for calculating a sample mean) increased â€”  Central Limit Theory confirmed

```

## Task 3

### a) Calculating the Expected Profit

```{r}
n <- 10000  # Number of simulations

# Room Configurations
suites <- 30
standard_rooms <- 120 - 2 * suites  # Number of standard rooms available

# Room Prices
standard_room_price <- 99
suite_price <- 189

# Define demand functions
standard_rooms_demand <- function(n) {
  rnorm(n, mean = 60, sd = 10)
}

suites_demand <- function(n) {
  rnorm(n, mean = 30, sd = 10)
}

# Generate simulated demands
standard_rooms_demand_sim <- pmax(0, round(standard_rooms_demand(n)))  # Simulated standard room demands
suites_demand_sim <- pmax(0, round(suites_demand(n)))  # Simulated suite demands

# Calculate standard rooms sold
standard_rooms_sold <- pmin(standard_rooms, standard_rooms_demand_sim)  # Rooms sold based on demand and availability

# Calculate overflow from standard rooms to suites
overflow_standard_to_suite <- pmax(0, standard_rooms_demand_sim - standard_rooms)  # Excess standard room demand

# Calculate suites sold for their original price
suite_sold_for_original_price <- pmin(suites, suites_demand_sim)

# Calculate overflow actually sold as suites
overflow_sold <- pmin(overflow_standard_to_suite, suites - suite_sold_for_original_price)

# Calculate suites occupied (suites sold for original price + suites sold due to overflow)
suites_occupied <- suite_sold_for_original_price + overflow_sold

# Revenue Calculation
revenue <- (standard_rooms_sold * standard_room_price) + 
           (overflow_sold * standard_room_price) + 
           (suite_sold_for_original_price * suite_price)

# Cost Calculation
cost <- 6000 + (15 * standard_rooms_sold) + (30 * suites_occupied)

# Profit per night
profit_per_night <- revenue - cost

# Output Results
mean_profit <- mean(profit_per_night)  # Average profit across simulations
mean_profit  # Print expected profit
```

### b)

We take our calculations from a) and change the number of suites and additionally test different configurations of suites to find the optimal number of suites.

```{r}
n <- 10000  # Number of simulations

# Room Prices
standard_room_price <- 99
suite_price <- 189

# Define demand functions
standard_rooms_demand <- function(n) {
  rnorm(n, mean = 60, sd = 10)
}

suites_demand <- function(n) {
  rnorm(n, mean = 30, sd = 10)
}

# Function to calculate expected profit for a given number of suites
calculate_profit <- function(suites) {
  standard_rooms <- 120 - 2 * suites  # Number of standard rooms available
  
  # Generate simulated demands
  standard_rooms_demand_sim <- pmax(0, round(standard_rooms_demand(n)))  # Simulated standard room demands
  suites_demand_sim <- pmax(0, round(suites_demand(n)))  # Simulated suite demands
  
  # Calculate standard rooms sold
  standard_rooms_sold <- pmin(standard_rooms, standard_rooms_demand_sim)
  
  # Calculate overflow from standard rooms to suites
  overflow_standard_to_suite <- pmax(0, standard_rooms_demand_sim - standard_rooms)
  
  # Calculate suites sold for their original price
  suite_sold_for_original_price <- pmin(suites, suites_demand_sim)
  
  # Calculate overflow actually sold as suites
  overflow_sold <- pmin(overflow_standard_to_suite, suites - suite_sold_for_original_price)
  
  # Calculate suites occupied
  suites_occupied <- suite_sold_for_original_price + overflow_sold
  
  # Revenue Calculation
  revenue <- (standard_rooms_sold * standard_room_price) + 
             (overflow_sold * standard_room_price) + 
             (suite_sold_for_original_price * suite_price)
  
  # Cost Calculation
  cost <- 6000 + (15 * standard_rooms_sold) + (30 * suites_occupied)
  
  # Profit per night
  profit_per_night <- revenue - cost
  
  # Return the mean profit
  mean(profit_per_night)
}

#Test different configurations of suites
suite_configurations<-seq(0, 60, by = 1)
profits<-sapply(suite_configurations, calculate_profit)
optimal_suites <- suite_configurations[which.max(profits)]
optimal_profit <- max(profits)
results <- data.frame(Suites = suite_configurations, Profit = profits)
print(results)
