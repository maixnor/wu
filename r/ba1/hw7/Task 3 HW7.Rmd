#Task a) Calculating the Expected Profit
```{r}
n <- 10000  # Number of simulations

# Room Configurations
suites <- 30
standard_rooms <- 120 - 2 * suites  # Number of standard rooms available

# Room Prices
standard_room_price <- 99
suite_price <- 189

# Define demand functions
standard_rooms_demand <- function(n) {
  rnorm(n, mean = 60, sd = 10)
}

suites_demand <- function(n) {
  rnorm(n, mean = 30, sd = 10)
}

# Generate simulated demands
standard_rooms_demand_sim <- pmax(0, round(standard_rooms_demand(n)))  # Simulated standard room demands
suites_demand_sim <- pmax(0, round(suites_demand(n)))  # Simulated suite demands

# Calculate standard rooms sold
standard_rooms_sold <- pmin(standard_rooms, standard_rooms_demand_sim)  # Rooms sold based on demand and availability

# Calculate overflow from standard rooms to suites
overflow_standard_to_suite <- pmax(0, standard_rooms_demand_sim - standard_rooms)  # Excess standard room demand

# Calculate suites sold for their original price
suite_sold_for_original_price <- pmin(suites, suites_demand_sim)

# Calculate overflow actually sold as suites
overflow_sold <- pmin(overflow_standard_to_suite, suites - suite_sold_for_original_price)

# Calculate suites occupied (suites sold for original price + suites sold due to overflow)
suites_occupied <- suite_sold_for_original_price + overflow_sold

# Revenue Calculation
revenue <- (standard_rooms_sold * standard_room_price) + 
           (overflow_sold * standard_room_price) + 
           (suite_sold_for_original_price * suite_price)

# Cost Calculation
cost <- 6000 + (15 * standard_rooms_sold) + (30 * suites_occupied)

# Profit per night
profit_per_night <- revenue - cost

# Output Results
mean_profit <- mean(profit_per_night)  # Average profit across simulations
mean_profit  # Print expected profit
```

# Task b)
We take our calculations from a) and change the number of suites and additionally test different configurations of suites to find the optimal number of suites.

  rnorm(n, mean = 60, sd = 10)
}

  rnorm(n, mean = 30, sd = 10)
}

  standard_rooms <- 120 - 2 * suites  # Number of standard rooms available
  
  # Generate simulated demands
