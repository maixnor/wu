# All things Code at WU

Everything so far I have done (coding wise) during the Bachelors Degree of Business and Economics @WU Vienna.

Basically everything which is not my obsidian vault (wu-quartz) is in here.

# R & nix

I use `tectonic` as a wrapper for Latex - not included in flake, but is straigtforward to install and use.

R is a statistical programming language heavily relying on arrays and pure functions.

>Nerdy Linux stuff ahead - you have been warned! 

Nix can be used on Windows through WSL or on MacOs using nix-darvin. Indulge at your own risk - can be very rewarding but is very complex at first.

For creating the R environment using nix run `nix develop` in the project root.

Then execute the files using the `justfile`
